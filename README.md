# ocaml-bert
Bert-like NLP models implemented in OCaml using the
[ocaml-torch](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/ocaml-torch) PyTorch bindings.

These are based on the [rust-bert](https://github.com/guillaume-be/rust-bert)
implementation which itself is a port of Huggingface's [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
to Rust.
